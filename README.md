# Penelope

The goal with Penelope is to create a free, independent and open source macOS text management and editing
tool. Eventually it will include a number of very attractive features relating to your notes:

* Modifying a note creates a new instance of it, allowing you to easily reference a
particular version of a note.

* Tags allows you to create and manage a meta structure for your notes. Find all notes related to a particular tag,
despite them being in different projects and notebooks.

* Graphs: Using a simple domain specific language a graph can be created. Graphs are practical to visualize data,
e.g. progress in a project. Every graph created can be included in any note. Modifying a graph creates a new instance
of the graph, allowing you to evolve a graph over time.

* Project Notes: A Project relates your Notes to your calendar, making it perfect for keeping track of the evolution
of a project related to e.g. meetings, user stories, product requirements, and so on.

* Notebooks: Used to organize notes. These notes are not necessarily tied to any dates or projects. You use a Notebook
when you are are more concerned about the content, then the relationship to other elements.
