Eventually Penelope will offer a number of very attractive features relating to writing and managing your notes:

* Markdown with life preview.

* Proper Version Handling: Modifying a note creates a new instance of it, allowing you to easily reference a
particular version of a note.

* Tags: Create and manage a meta structure for your notes. Find all notes related to a particular tag,
despite them being in different projects and notebooks. You can also do binary operations to exclude and require combinations of different tags.

* Graphs: Using a simple domain specific language a graph can be created. Graphs are practical to visualize data,
e.g. progress in a project. Every graph created can be included in any note. Modifying a graph creates a new instance
of the graph, allowing you to evolve a graph over time.

* Projects: A Project ties your Notes to your calendar and a timeline, making it perfect for keeping track of the evolution
of a project. Things like meetings, user stories, product requirements, and so on that evolve over time - and to be easily able to control exactly when is critical.

* Notebooks: Used to organize notes when the timeline is not critical. These notes are usually not tied to any dates or projects. You use a Notebook when you are only focused on the most recent state of your notes.

* People and Assets: Easily create a list of resources, like people and meeting rooms, and link them to your notes.
